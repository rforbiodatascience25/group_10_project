## Data Retrieval
All data used in this project is from the following study: [Multi-Resistance Antibiotic Susceptibility](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilimadeddinehosni/multi-resistance-antibiotic-susceptibility/data/code) 

The library "RKaggle" needs to be downloaded to retreive the data in the program.

## Multidrug Antibiotic Resistance Analysis

This repository contains a reproducible workflow for cleaning, augmenting, and analyzing a multidrug-resistant bacteria dataset.

All scripts are written in R and produce cleaned datasets, augmented datasets, visualizations, and linear model analyses.
