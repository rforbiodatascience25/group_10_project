# Antibiotic Resistance

At this project we used data from: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilimadeddinehosni/multi-resistance-antibiotic-susceptibility/data>

## Loading Data

## Cleaning the data

## Data Argument

-   Loaded cleaned bacteria datase

-   Added antibiotic names and classes

-   Reshaped to long format and joined tables

-   Created MDR score (R = 1, I = 0.5, S = 0)

-   Converted variables to factors and added age groups

-   Final outputs: aug_long_bacteria_data.csv and aug_wide_bacteria_data.csv

## Describe

```{r, results='asis'}
htmltools::includeHTML(here::here("results/images/table1_resized.html"))
```

## Linear Model MDR

## Linear Model Infection frequency

## Bacterial Resistance Heatmap

![](images/heatmap_resistance.png){fig-align="center" width="4500"}

Shows resistance patterns across bacterial species using the long-format dataset: E. coli and K. pneumoniae show the highest resistance (red), most other species remain largely sensitive (blue), and several antibiotics stay effective across multiple species.
