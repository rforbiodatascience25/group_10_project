# Antibiotic Resistance

## Bacterial Resistance Heatmap

This heatmap shows the frequency of resistance of different bacterial species to a range of antibiotics. Colors re\[resent the proportion of resistant isolates, with blue indicating low resistance, white intermediate and red high resistance.

Key observations from the heatmap:

-   Escherichia Coli and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* show the highest overall resistance to several antibiotics (red areas).

-   Most other species display lower resistance (mostly blue to light purple), suggesting they are more sensitive.

-   some antibiotics appear more effective across multiple species, as indicated by consistently low resistance frequencies.

-   The heatmap allows rapid visualization of susceptibility patterns, highlighting potential treatment challenges for highly resistant species.
