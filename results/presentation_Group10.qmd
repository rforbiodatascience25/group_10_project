## Antibiotic Resistance

At this project we used data from: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilimadeddinehosni/multi-resistance-antibiotic-susceptibility/data>

### Dataset Overview

-   \~10,000 bacterial isolated tested against 15+ antibiotics from 4 major families

-   Each row: unique bacterial strain + patient demographics + clinical risk factors + antibiotic susceptibility results

-   Enables:

    -   Multi-drug resistance (MDR) analysis

    -   Study of patient risk factors vs. resistance

    -   Epidemiological trends across antibiotic classes

    -   Handling missing/inconsistent data

### Antibiotic Families

**β-lactams** (cell wall inhibitors)

AMX/AMP, AMC, CZ, FOX, CTX/CRO, IPM

### Bacterial Resistance Heatmap

This heatmap shows the frequency of resistance of different bacterial species to a range of antibiotics. Colors re\[resent the proportion of resistant isolates, with blue indicating low resistance, white intermediate and red high resistance.

Key observations from the heatmap:

-   Escherichia Coli and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* show the highest overall resistance to several antibiotics (red areas).

-   Most other species display lower resistance (mostly blue to light purple), suggesting they are more sensitive.

-   some antibiotics appear more effective across multiple species, as indicated by consistently low resistance frequencies.

-   The heatmap allows rapid visualization of susceptibility patterns, highlighting potential treatment challenges for highly resistant species.
